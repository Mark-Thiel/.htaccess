            "[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  And then I...\n",

            "[10:49.000 --> 10:52.000]  That is probably a good match for us.\n",
            "[10:52.000 --> 11:00.000]  It's a learning curve, this craziness between the technology and the content with it.\n",

            "[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  Ann Marie Yates in Monique's Bureau, Training, Outreach, and Special Projects.\n",
            "[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  I've been here for eight years, was with PNP for nine years prior to coming over here.\n",
            "[13:51.000 --> 13:56.000]  And I'll be working in the county.\n",
            "[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  And I'm Kim Heffner.\n",
            "[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  My background is mainly in financial and customer service training.\n",
            "[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  Great.\n",
            "[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  Perfect.\n",
            "[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  Thank you.\n",
            "[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  All right.\n",
            "[14:06.000 --> 14:11.000]  So Mark, Ann Marie, and I, Ron is unexpectedly out this week.\n",
            "[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  We had a meeting just really kind of trying to kick this off and discuss the logistics of moving this project forward,\n",
            "[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  which obviously there's going to be a lot of logistics, and we know that.\n",
            "[14:21.000 --> 14:31.000]  And a lot of it is going to be needing support from state staff and also from local district staff.\n",
            "[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  So what we wanted to do as one of the first steps is really get to meet a couple of the bureaus, you know,\n",
            "[14:36.000 --> 14:43.000]  two at a time that have similar connection with the districts and connections with some of the topics\n",
            "[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  and have smaller meetings.\n",
            "[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  The next ones will probably be PPO and systems together\n",
            "[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  and just really get from each of the bureaus just a broad sense of some of the, you know,\n",
            "[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  policy has given us currently their top five, as you can tell.\n",
            "[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  But we want to just get a sense from each of the bureaus what the top items are that they hear,\n",
            "[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  they receive questions on.\n",
            "[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  And we'll do that with each of the bureaus,\n",
            "[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  and then that will kind of allow us to assimilate the information together,\n",
            "[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  get a sense of commonalities across bureaus if there's any one topic\n",
            "[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  or any couple of topics that come through as, you know,\n",
            "[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  priorities that we get commonly in this office and whether or not that translates into a district.\n",
            "[15:28.000 --> 15:37.000]  So we'll be using the subject matter experts in-house, whatever we decide to focus on in whatever order.\n",
            "[15:37.000 --> 15:43.000]  We talked a little bit about we always want to keep a couple of different topics manual-wise going\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:48.000]  at the same time just in case a subject matter expert isn't available to, say, help us on DMV.\n",
            "[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  We're working on property institution meetings.\n",
            "[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  We may have a different subject matter expert, and we can continue to move things along as we go.\n",
            "[15:55.000 --> 16:01.000]  So we don't want to just be so solely focused that if we're working on one topic, it can't move anywhere,\n",
            "[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  so we're waiting for the review process to go.\n",
            "[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  And what we want to do is we're going to, after we do these smaller bureau meetings,\n",
            "[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  we're going to start having a team internal to really start having some meetings\n",
            "[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  to have these conversations as we move along.\n",
            "[16:13.000 --> 16:18.000]  So everyone, each of the bureaus is aware of what we're working on, how we're progressing,\n",
            "[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  what we need in order to support the progress along the way.\n",
            "[16:22.000 --> 16:27.000]  And then we also talked, because Mark is not familiar with being in a district or in child support,\n",
            "[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  that Mark will spend some time in a couple of different districts really getting a sense from them\n",
            "[16:31.000 --> 16:38.000]  where they get their information now and how we can better support maybe that as an interim solution.\n",
            "[16:38.000 --> 16:45.000]  I think Dan has spent a lot of time recently redoing ERS in order to support districts access to information,\n",
            "[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  but also really looking at what districts have.\n",
            "[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  And, you know, I was telling Mark, and Karen, you're less so like this, but seriously,\n",
            "[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  everything that I use all the time is taped to my wall.\n",
            "[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  And I think when we go to districts, that is the most common thing.\n",
            "[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  It's like wallpaper.\n",
            "[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  And you can tell how long someone's been there by how much they have on their wall.\n",
            "[17:04.000 --> 17:05.000]  Exactly.\n",
            "[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  At least it's covered like that.\n",
            "[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  And Larry just has big binders taped to his wall.\n",
            "[17:09.000 --> 17:10.000]  Yeah, everywhere.\n",
            "[17:10.000 --> 17:11.000]  Larry Dole.\n",
            "[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  And he knows each and every one of them.\n",
            "[17:13.000 --> 17:14.000]  Yes.\n",
            "[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  So we just want to get a sense from the local district, because they're our end users.\n",
            "[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  We want to get a sense from them what's important to them,\n",
            "[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  and really also getting a key users group in the local districts to help us kind of shepherd this along,\n",
            "[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  because we want their feedback as we move along the process.\n",
            "[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  How do you think you'll be selecting what districts?\n",
            "[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  I think we're going to be working here internally to kind of weed.\n",
            "[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  We're going to ask for participants,\n",
            "[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  but what we don't want is to get the same five or six districts that we get for everything.\n",
            "[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  We want to make sure that we have representation in big, small, and medium districts,\n",
            "[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  so that whatever we do goes across the state.\n",
            "[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  Across the state, too, because we do get a little Albany-centric sometimes.\n",
            "[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  Yeah, we'll be working.\n",
            "[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  And the good thing about our process is we are allowed to.\n",
            "[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  We do have the opportunity to bring these individuals in to do a focus group in-house\n",
            "[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  and really kind of move it along.\n",
            "[18:08.000 --> 18:09.000]  I love that.\n",
            "[18:09.000 --> 18:11.000]  I just want to say I do love that,\n",
            "[18:11.000 --> 18:17.000]  and I love the idea with those district selections of picking some core performers\n",
            "[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  in addition to the really good performers.\n",
            "[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  I think that it would be interesting if that is insightful.\n",
            "[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  Well, we also want to make sure that we have voice of experienced workers versus new workers,\n",
            "[18:31.000 --> 18:38.000]  so it's going to be really a big mix of new and younger workers\n",
            "[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  who receive their information differently.\n",
            "[18:41.000 --> 18:47.000]  Having said all that, I think that is so important,\n",
            "[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  and I do really like the idea of the voice of the customer and the focus groups,\n",
            "[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  but I'm really impatient on this project, too,\n",
            "[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  and I don't know if there's a way to kind of mesh those things\n",
            "[18:59.000 --> 19:06.000]  to really how we can really see some progress and some product coming out.\n",
            "[19:06.000 --> 19:14.000]  I just want to share that that's certainly an interesting expectation that I have,\n",
            "[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  that we're seeing some product coming out of this,\n",
            "[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  and, again, I see it as being bits and pieces as opposed to one beautiful manual\n",
            "[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  just so that we are getting things out.\n",
            "[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  And the other thing I just wanted to mention,\n",
            "[19:28.000 --> 19:33.000]  and then I'm going to sit back and try to be quiet,\n",
            "[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  is if that also could, and I think this is the idea,\n",
            "[19:37.000 --> 19:49.000]  if those areas that are either confusing and have those frequent questions coming from the district\n",
            "[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  so they clearly need those cross feeds,\n",
            "[19:53.000 --> 19:59.000]  and also if it's areas where we know it can improve performance,\n",
            "[19:59.000 --> 20:03.000]  improve customer service to our families,\n",
            "[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  I'd love to be able to prioritize that way.\n",
            "[20:06.000 --> 20:09.000]  And that was one of the things we also had discussed a little bit is,\n",
            "[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  I mean, this is the first step of internally at least selecting one or two we want to focus on\n",
            "[20:13.000 --> 20:16.000]  so we can start looking at a product,\n",
            "[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  because one of the things that's going to take a little while\n",
            "[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  is determining the format of what we put out there, how are we going to put it out there.\n",
            "[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  I have shared with the team, and I actually think everyone here has seen the DMV manual\n",
            "[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  that New York City put out there.\n",
            "[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  You know, there's certain, okay, I'll send it to you,\n",
            "[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  but I know you've seen it, right, Susanna?\n",
            "[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  I sent it to you, Amy, you have it, Karen.\n",
            "[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  And really just getting a sense of, you know, get some examples,\n",
            "[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  and Karen, you were going to ask some of the districts for whether or not they had examples of manuals\n",
            "[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  that they had developed.\n",
            "[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Have you been able to do that?\n",
            "[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  I'm sorry, I'm blanking on that.\n",
            "[20:52.000 --> 20:53.000]  Okay, all right.\n",
            "[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  I don't recall that request.\n",
            "[20:54.000 --> 20:57.000]  Okay, so if you could, we're working manuals?\n",
            "[20:57.000 --> 20:58.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  New York City, okay, right.\n",
            "[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  You had said that New York City has it.\n",
            "[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  New York City has, you know, there's actually an intranet link in Central Port\n",
            "[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  that you can get all of New York City's, most of them anyway, their museum manuals.\n",
            "[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  And I think you had mentioned Monroe as being another one that might have some museum manuals.\n",
            "[21:13.000 --> 21:17.000]  We'll touch base and try to move along and try to get an example.\n",
            "[21:17.000 --> 21:21.000]  No, that's okay, because we want to get as much as out there now,\n",
            "[21:21.000 --> 21:24.000]  because why reinvent the wheel if there's some stuff in New York City\n",
            "[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  that New York City has some strong information,\n",
            "[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  because they already contracted with CUNY to do some of their stuff.\n",
            "[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  But that doesn't mean that's the way we have to go,\n",
            "[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  but it's good to inform us of other approaches,\n",
            "[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  and then we can ask some of their users,\n",
            "[21:37.000 --> 21:40.000]  if you had to improve on this, what would you do kind of thing.\n",
            "[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  So we want to make sure this is really we're moving in the right way.\n",
            "[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  We can use some of their manuals and give it to other districts and say,\n",
            "[21:46.000 --> 21:47.000]  what do you think of this?\n",
            "[21:47.000 --> 21:51.000]  So we want to make sure that whatever we're designing is of the most use,\n",
            "[21:51.000 --> 21:54.000]  it's in the right place, it's searchable, it's usable,\n",
            "[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  and it's most meaningful to districts.\n",
            "[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  We talked a little bit about some blended learning in terms of a DMV.\n",
            "[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  Here's your manual, here's this section.\n",
            "[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  We can have a video that really walks them through screen by screen\n",
            "[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  how they do something or this is what it means.\n",
            "[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  So Lilith and Dan and those guys, so the whole training team at some point\n",
            "[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  will be involved as we develop to make sure that we're not just getting\n",
            "[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  a paper manual that is just a paper manual that they can get a little bit more,\n",
            "[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  because the next generation tends to learn more in visual\n",
            "[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  than actual in the paper.\n",
            "[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  So we want to make sure that this has a long shelf life\n",
            "[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  and that we also have a process that in the future that any time, say,\n",
            "[22:33.000 --> 22:37.000]  policy is releasing an enhancement or system is releasing an enhancement\n",
            "[22:37.000 --> 22:41.000]  to a particular process, that we have a plan for how we would update it\n",
            "[22:41.000 --> 22:45.000]  in whatever format we end up having and that it's a timely update.\n",
            "[22:45.000 --> 22:50.000]  So there's just a lot of things to kind of move along.\n",
            "[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  And Karen, certainly if you want to give us something similar to...\n",
            "[22:55.000 --> 22:59.000]  I actually do a printed out or a parlock of questions from the past month.\n",
            "[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Do you have them by volume or is it just...\n",
            "[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Well, I sorted them several ways.\n",
            "[23:05.000 --> 23:14.000]  I can do it by descriptor code, topic, category, email subject, comments,\n",
            "[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  and we have a whole bunch of different...\n",
            "[23:16.000 --> 23:20.000]  You know, it's really up to your team to figure out what is most important\n",
            "[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  to what you're seeing from districts.\n",
            "[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Well, yeah, but I'm saying like right now,\n",
            "[23:24.000 --> 23:27.000]  just the sort of agency type of things we get from districts,\n",
            "[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  this is a very basic...\n",
            "[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to share that, that would be a good thing,\n",
            "[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  but I think I'd like to see a top five.\n",
            "[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Well, sure, and I'll tell you, the top three,\n",
            "[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  in discussion with the people who have been working in the mailbox\n",
            "[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  most closely, they've identified the top three of COLA,\n",
            "[23:41.000 --> 23:46.000]  enclosure, and text, basically, so they're pretty much consistent\n",
            "[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  with what I think they have here.\n",
            "[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  But they tend to be very process-oriented, how do I,\n",
            "[23:52.000 --> 23:55.000]  not really broader policy, federal legal type questions.\n",
            "[23:55.000 --> 23:59.000]  We either get 10,000 foot questions or very granular questions.\n",
            "[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  We're not really involved in the field,\n",
            "[24:01.000 --> 24:04.000]  but it seems like people really need a lot of guidance just in how do I do this\n",
            "[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  or basic eligibility, why is this case not going in.\n",
            "[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  I think to compliment New York City on how they approached the DMV,\n",
            "[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  they did a really good job on their manual and really laying it out.\n",
            "[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  Yeah, they were step-by-step.\n",
            "[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  And I think that that's one thing we want to do is the bottom line on this\n",
            "[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  is we want to make the look and feel of every, however,\n",
            "[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  if you call them chapters, of every one we do,\n",
            "[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  the look and feel very close in format so that when Joan goes to look at\n",
            "[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  property execution, Anne-Marie looks at DMV, she has an expectation of what\n",
            "[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  she's going to find in there because she knows what the breakdown is\n",
            "[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  and where she's going to find it.\n",
            "[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  But we'll be working on refining that as we move along.\n",
            "[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  I'm not sure if we're getting way ahead of ourselves here,\n",
            "[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  but one thing I noticed, the other category of questions we get a lot is should I.\n",
            "[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  I know what the policy says.\n",
            "[25:00.000 --> 25:01.000]  I read the DCL.\n",
            "[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  Should I do this on this case?\n",
            "[25:03.000 --> 25:06.000]  I'm wondering if somewhere in there they could be considered decision trees\n",
            "[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  in terms of at least guiding people in what they need to consider towards\n",
            "[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  getting towards a decision without making the decision for them.\n",
            "[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  And I think that we talked a little bit about Dan, Hills, Interstate,\n",
            "[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  kind of the visuals.\n",
            "[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  There's a multipurpose way of doing this.\n",
            "[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  That's what I'm thinking of actually.\n",
            "[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Okay, so what do I want to do next?\n",
            "[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Okay, now what do I do type of thing.\n",
            "[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  And that's great feedback because the more ways we can put the information out there,\n",
            "[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  it may be that, you know, you go out there\n",
            "[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  and you need a decision tree to get you to there, whereas, you know, Joan,\n",
            "[25:37.000 --> 25:38.000]  I guarantee Joan's going to read it.\n",
            "[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  Joan's going to read it, and she's going to get her decision that way.\n",
            "[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  But we want to make sure we hit all the different ways that people learn.\n",
            "[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  And I do think in the sort of research going out to the districts,\n",
            "[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  I think it would be good for them to get feedback on the USA, you know,\n",
            "[25:55.000 --> 25:58.000]  because I think there might be different perspectives.\n",
            "[25:58.000 --> 26:05.000]  Yes, this is good for this, but it could be enriched by this piece.\n",
            "[26:05.000 --> 26:09.000]  And the other thing we want to do is, you know, in conjunction with systems,\n",
            "[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  because they're going to be partnering on this as well,\n",
            "[26:11.000 --> 26:16.000]  is we want to make sure that we're the user's guide, the SS user's guide,\n",
            "[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  and our program manual somehow don't live separately,\n",
            "[26:21.000 --> 26:25.000]  that they are going back and forth to each other because there could be different ways.\n",
            "[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  So if they're talking about, you know, the COLA screen on assets,\n",
            "[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  that there is a way on assets to link them to the programmatic information,\n",
            "[26:34.000 --> 26:35.000]  the policy information here.\n",
            "[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  Right now on assets you just say this is the code, but it's not the why is it this code,\n",
            "[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  how did it get there, blah, blah, blah.\n",
            "[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  So we need to have a cross-linking to those and some chemistry.\n",
            "[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  As long as it doesn't phase out.\n",
            "[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  It will not, no, no, no, because it's going to.\n",
            "[26:50.000 --> 26:55.000]  Even if we can get out there and then make it beautiful later.\n",
            "[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  Right, and I think what we talked about is really choosing a couple of smaller topics,\n",
            "[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  very discrete topics to kind of move our way through.\n",
            "[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  Because if we choose something that's huge, it's going to take a long time.\n",
            "[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  The other thing that I'm going to put out there to all of the viewers as we talk to them is\n",
            "[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  we will be asking every viewer to designate a subject matter expert.\n",
            "[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  We're going to have expectations that if we set milestones and deliverables through this process,\n",
            "[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  that we're going to try all the subject matter experts.\n",
            "[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  We'll work with them to try to establish those,\n",
            "[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  but they will try on their side as much as possible to meet those.\n",
            "[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  In terms of if I give you a chapter for review and I say we need this by two weeks,\n",
            "[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  we're not going to go day turnarounds, but we want to make sure that everyone is,\n",
            "[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  if you're the subject matter expert on PECS,\n",
            "[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  then you're going to know what the milestones and deliverables are as we move along.\n",
            "[27:44.000 --> 27:48.000]  So you know what to plan in your workload for that.\n",
            "[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  And you're envisioning like two or three different topics going at any time.\n",
            "[27:51.000 --> 27:56.000]  You're going to circle, you know, start one off, then start the next off.\n",
            "[27:56.000 --> 27:59.000]  Yeah, so we'll get our way down here, and then we'll start another.\n",
            "[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  Because a lot of it is Mark and me working on development while people are doing review.\n",
            "[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  So it'll work out pretty well.\n",
            "[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  But the other thing that I want to do is we want to have some initial conversations\n",
            "[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  about what people's visions are for what will be covered in this manual on that kind of stuff.\n",
            "[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  And Dan has already, Dan, Helen, and Lila,\n",
            "[28:16.000 --> 28:20.000]  because they know where all the information lies between the EDMs and the DCLs and all of that.\n",
            "[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  They're going to be great supporters of this as well because they will be feeding Mark,\n",
            "[28:24.000 --> 28:29.000]  okay, this is all the places we found that have this information.\n",
            "[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  And when we do the sit-down meetings and D&B, the sit-down meeting will be, okay,\n",
            "[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  these are the documents we've identified so far as containing D&B information\n",
            "[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  that somehow has to get into whatever this program manual is.\n",
            "[28:41.000 --> 28:45.000]  Any of the subject matter experts do you know of any other place we need to be looking.\n",
            "[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  So we're not saying, you know, Mark isn't going down two months of development,\n",
            "[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  and someone says, oh, jeez, you totally forgot to look at this.\n",
            "[28:53.000 --> 28:59.000]  So we want to make sure we really have some strong conversations at the beginning to move our way along.\n",
            "[28:59.000 --> 29:04.000]  But again, it's going to be an evolving process, and it may be after we do the first couple,\n",
            "[29:04.000 --> 29:08.000]  when we do three and four, we may go back and have to tweak one and two\n",
            "[29:08.000 --> 29:11.000]  because we found a different way that's a little bit more effective.\n",
            "[29:11.000 --> 29:15.000]  So it's a work in progress, but, yes, we do want to start getting some milestones and deliverables\n",
            "[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  once we figure out what we want to do topic-wise, choosing two.\n",
            "[29:21.000 --> 29:28.000]  And, again, Karen, so it looks like you, case closure, COLA, I don't see PECS on.\n",
            "[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  No, we don't.\n",
            "[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  No one we don't have.\n",
            "[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  No, PECS is one that sometimes comes out to be the should I more than anything.\n",
            "[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  Should I do this? Should I do that?\n",
            "[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  And we did do the two separate pieces here.\n",
            "[29:40.000 --> 29:46.000]  One is, yes, we get all these questions, but these are also some other topics here that are important\n",
            "[29:46.000 --> 29:53.000]  that aren't necessarily asked about, but we're always telling about.\n",
            "[29:53.000 --> 29:54.000]  Right.\n",
            "[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  No, and absolutely, and I think that there's going to be some catch-all things.\n",
            "[29:57.000 --> 30:02.000]  So we're going to have more conversations, but it's important for us to get this type of list\n",
            "[30:02.000 --> 30:08.000]  so Mark can kind of put them out there and see where there's overlap, and then we have a bigger group discussion,\n",
            "[30:08.000 --> 30:12.000]  kind of like our priorities discussion with the bureau chiefs, which, you know,\n",
            "[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  here's the 20 topics, which ones do we want to hit, you know, here, the first five,\n",
            "[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  and then maybe we get input from districts in terms of what they think out of the five\n",
            "[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  is their most important priority.\n",
            "[30:24.000 --> 30:28.000]  But we don't want to take that, have that take all that long.\n",
            "[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  Now in terms of you said moving among several subjects because of the timing,\n",
            "[30:32.000 --> 30:41.000]  the availability of subject matter experts, some of these issues lie with different bureaus,\n",
            "[30:41.000 --> 30:48.000]  and I guess would it make sense to choose among the several that we're doing at the same time,\n",
            "[30:48.000 --> 30:52.000]  choose them from several different bureaus because of the availability of the experts?\n",
            "[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  We won't be choosing three topics that Joan's the only expert on,\n",
            "[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  but we'll be trying to spread it around.\n",
            "[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  Absolutely. Good point.\n",
            "[31:02.000 --> 31:06.000]  So any, I mean, Karen, if you can share whatever you have\n",
            "[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  and whichever one you think is most meaningful to the team, I think that will allow Mark.\n",
            "[31:12.000 --> 31:16.000]  And so what the plan is now is that Mark, obviously, is our technical writer.\n",
            "[31:16.000 --> 31:18.000]  He'll be working with everyone on this.\n",
            "[31:18.000 --> 31:26.000]  He's going to kind of serve as a liaison primarily between Suzanne, you and I at this point to push things through.\n",
            "[31:26.000 --> 31:30.000]  And then we'll just, as time goes on, we're going to just have to find how this works.\n",
            "[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  But we're going to make sure that the information as it's getting developed is available on SharePoint\n",
            "[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  so people can go in and look, that we get some milestones and deliverables\n",
            "[31:38.000 --> 31:43.000]  and we have that available on SharePoint so people can see, you know, what's on deck,\n",
            "[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  what's being worked on, what's on deck, and then really have some conversations.\n",
            "[31:47.000 --> 31:53.000]  And then when we start working with the local district users, I'll be putting out to the bureau chiefs, okay,\n",
            "[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  who we want to participate on this.\n",
            "[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  And it can change, I mean, obviously, depending on the subject matter experts.\n",
            "[31:58.000 --> 32:03.000]  But it would be beneficial for the subject matter experts to say DMV is our first thing we choose,\n",
            "[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  for the subject matter experts to hear what the districts are hearing,\n",
            "[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  not just someone who is in your bureau designated to that,\n",
            "[32:09.000 --> 32:15.000]  but we want to make sure they also are hearing what the districts are thinking is important\n",
            "[32:15.000 --> 32:19.000]  in terms of whatever their subject matter expert on.\n",
            "[32:19.000 --> 32:23.000]  But, again, this is preliminary, and we're going to be advancing this soon along.\n",
            "[32:23.000 --> 32:27.000]  To what extent are we going to be involving legal?\n",
            "[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  Do we have a designee from there to look at any of this?\n",
            "[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  We haven't even had a conversation, but I think we should probably.\n",
            "[32:33.000 --> 32:43.000]  I mean, you know, some of these topics might be helpful to have someone involved.\n",
            "[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  Absolutely.\n",
            "[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  Board, final questions.\n",
            "[32:47.000 --> 32:54.000]  Well, they're going to have to review this as well.\n",
            "[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Of course, they have their own manual to work on, too.\n",
            "[32:56.000 --> 33:01.000]  Right.\n",
            "[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  Maybe that's a different conversation to three and a half years ago now,\n",
            "[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  say what I said when I first started.\n",
            "[33:08.000 --> 33:17.000]  So I guess what I would say about that is that to the extent we think it has some legal vulnerability,\n",
            "[33:17.000 --> 33:21.000]  then I would say and I would rely on policy to play it for that purpose.\n",
            "[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  Otherwise, it's what we have in place now.\n",
            "[33:24.000 --> 33:25.000]  It's operational.\n",
            "[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  It's an operational manual.\n",
            "[33:27.000 --> 33:33.000]  So my initial thinking is I'm less inclined to require that legal review it.\n",
            "[33:33.000 --> 33:40.000]  Again, if there are areas, if it's distribution, for example, or some other areas,\n",
            "[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  I guess I would rely on, you know, in all of this.\n",
            "[33:44.000 --> 33:45.000]  I was thinking more PECs.\n",
            "[33:45.000 --> 33:46.000]  I was thinking PECs.\n",
            "[33:46.000 --> 33:47.000]  That would be the one that I would look at.\n",
            "[33:47.000 --> 33:48.000]  Exactly.\n",
            "[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  Judgments, you know, things like that.\n",
            "[33:50.000 --> 33:51.000]  Absolutely.\n",
            "[33:51.000 --> 33:52.000]  I guess that's what I'm envisioning.\n",
            "[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  I rely on your expertise as well.\n",
            "[33:55.000 --> 34:01.000]  And on the OLA agenda, we can put this as case closure operations.\n",
            "[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  We can at least say what we're working on.\n",
            "[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  And, again, this is not an ADM.\n",
            "[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  It's an operational caseworker.\n",
            "[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  That's a manual.\n",
            "[34:12.000 --> 34:15.000]  But I think that's an excellent point.\n",
            "[34:15.000 --> 34:22.000]  And there likely will be pieces that do need to be flagged.\n",
            "[34:22.000 --> 34:28.000]  And certainly our goal is to make this as easy to read, comprehend.\n",
            "[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  What are you saying, Monique?\n",
            "[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  I don't know what I'm saying.\n",
            "[34:34.000 --> 34:42.000]  So we'll be translating policy documents.\n",
            "[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  I think, like, we all have grown to love the travel system.\n",
            "[34:46.000 --> 34:52.000]  And, I mean, because those instructions are so difficult that it's easier to just\n",
            "[34:52.000 --> 34:55.000]  find the one person in the office who knows how to do it and ask them.\n",
            "[34:55.000 --> 34:58.000]  And I think we get that a lot from the district, too.\n",
            "[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  So it's easier to just call or send an email.\n",
            "[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  But, you know, you've got to teach them.\n",
            "[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  And that's going to be the other thing, too, is as we develop these,\n",
            "[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  we are going to have to put what we need to market them as soon as we release them.\n",
            "[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  It's saying whatever topic we do first.\n",
            "[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  It doesn't hurt us to do a webinar that says we're going to walk you through this.\n",
            "[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  This is a manual.\n",
            "[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  And as we go through it so then they have an expectation, they know what it is.\n",
            "[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  A lot of times we release stuff, we don't ever talk about it,\n",
            "[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  so they don't really know that it's there.\n",
            "[35:27.000 --> 35:31.000]  But, you know, I know for myself a lot of times, oh, yeah, oh, yeah,\n",
            "[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  was I supposed to read that or was I just supposed to print it\n",
            "[35:34.000 --> 35:40.000]  and put it in my office kind of thing.\n",
            "[35:40.000 --> 35:43.000]  And, again, certainly if you have any questions, if you have any ideas,\n",
            "[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  we're going to keep this a very open-ended.\n",
            "[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  Any ideas or recommendations or care when we get some of the manuals\n",
            "[35:49.000 --> 35:53.000]  and that information back, you know, try to funnel it through, Mark,\n",
            "[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  with the CC that Ann Marie and myself and Ron,\n",
            "[35:57.000 --> 36:02.000]  and we'll just continue to move forward.\n",
            "[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  And, Suzanne, do you want to talk about your topics\n",
            "[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  or do you want to just at this point we'll just have it as a list\n",
            "[36:08.000 --> 36:12.000]  and then as we get further we'll have more clarification on topics.\n",
            "[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  Yeah, one thing I sort of added on here too that I'm noticing here a lot\n",
            "[36:16.000 --> 36:20.000]  is not really jumping out because I have to look into some of the notes\n",
            "[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  to actually see it, but unassigning a URA seems to be a big one too.\n",
            "[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Why did the system do this?\n",
            "[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  Why did the system move money?\n",
            "[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  A URA?\n",
            "[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  We'll talk about that.\n",
            "[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  Yeah, if you thought the pharmaceutical industry was a steep learning curve,\n",
            "[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  wait for the stuff to start coming in.\n",
            "[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  So people are wondering about the automated processes\n",
            "[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  that the system itself is doing and why is it doing that.\n",
            "[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  That's a big one.\n",
            "[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  Why didn't the system do this?\n",
            "[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  It sounds like several of your issues there are about that.\n",
            "[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  And that's something that could be done through a webinar,\n",
            "[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  you know, instead of prioritized here,\n",
            "[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  that maybe that's informing that there needs to be a webinar.\n",
            "[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Yeah, and some of these may just reveal topics\n",
            "[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  that we should just do a half-hour webinar on.\n",
            "[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  And Ron had talked to me about that,\n",
            "[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  and I said that I thought the topics here would really inform\n",
            "[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  what districts wanted to do.\n",
            "[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  I'm kind of holding that discussion off to a discussion.\n",
            "[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  Any other questions?\n",
            "[37:23.000 --> 37:29.000]  I think this is a very important topic and project,\n",
            "[37:29.000 --> 37:33.000]  but I think that, you know, it's so as we transition,\n",
            "[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  we know we've seen a lot of turnover in districts.\n",
            "[37:35.000 --> 37:39.000]  We know that there's not a lot of good information out there,\n",
            "[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  well, easily accessible information out there for them to find it.\n",
            "[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  Some topics have information in five different documents\n",
            "[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  and they don't necessarily know which is the most recent.\n",
            "[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  Or it was the person who wrote the document's perception\n",
            "[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  of what was the most important thing was,\n",
            "[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  and now 10 years later we realize that wasn't the most important.\n",
            "[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  Maybe that was the most important thing in 2005,\n",
            "[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  but now in 2016 it's not.\n",
            "[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  So I'm thinking URA in particular in that one.\n",
            "[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  It's just a matured process at this point.\n",
            "[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  The needs are very different.\n",
            "[38:07.000 --> 38:10.000]  Or do they have a lot of overlap between documents as well\n",
            "[38:10.000 --> 38:14.000]  where you've got, you know, 10 different documents\n",
            "[38:14.000 --> 38:17.000]  that are 1,000 pages all together,\n",
            "[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  however these 10 different ones are covering.\n",
            "[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  What if they're covering the same topic over and over\n",
            "[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  and people are deluged with paper?\n",
            "[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  I don't have time to read all this,\n",
            "[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  but it could be boiled down to, pared down.\n",
            "[38:29.000 --> 38:33.000]  And sometimes we retain 80% of the content in this document\n",
            "[38:33.000 --> 38:37.000]  and refer back to the 20% that was still valid in this document,\n",
            "[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  but the 80% is not valid any longer.\n",
            "[38:39.000 --> 38:42.000]  So we're doing much better at that now.\n",
            "[38:42.000 --> 38:45.000]  We're trying to make it all inclusive.\n",
            "[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  As a bit of, I don't want to say a complicating factor,\n",
            "[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  but just something that also points to the need for a manual as well,\n",
            "[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  is many of our coordinators,\n",
            "[38:52.000 --> 38:56.000]  our program managers in the local districts are retiring,\n",
            "[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  and as new people come in,\n",
            "[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  many of them don't really have a lot of program experience.\n",
            "[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  So in the past we had noted that generally people came up through the program,\n",
            "[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  so when they were the leader of the district program,\n",
            "[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  they knew the whole program.\n",
            "[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  And now we're finding people are coming in from the outside,\n",
            "[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  they're coming in from different program areas,\n",
            "[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  they're being hired completely from the outside,\n",
            "[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  and they don't have the experience they need in management as well.\n",
            "[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  So it's kind of interesting.\n",
            "[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  We had a lot of people who grew up with our program\n",
            "[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  and then all started retiring at the same time.\n",
            "[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  We have a lot of people out there that...\n",
            "[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  Yeah, they are, the institutional knowledge, absolutely.\n",
            "[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  Yeah, I think this is the term I was searching for,\n",
            "[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  institutional knowledge.\n",
            "[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  So they themselves don't know how the workers go look over here.\n",
            "[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  Just that I, again, was asked to identify my top three priorities,\n",
            "[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  and this was one of them.\n",
            "[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  No pressure.\n",
            "[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  No pressure.\n",
            "[39:54.000 --> 40:02.000]  We're going to count the daily and monthly reconciliation\n",
            "[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  as our first product out the door on this.\n",
            "[40:05.000 --> 40:08.000]  We're going to have one out the door.\n",
            "[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  I'm very happy.\n",
            "[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  We may have cheated on that one, but...\n",
            "[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  That's all right.\n",
            "[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  And again, you know...\n",
            "[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  It's important.\n",
            "[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's definitely needed.\n",
            "[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  And, Karen, we were going to touch base with you next week\n",
            "[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  into a couple of districts where Mark might be able to go and get...\n",
            "[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  Yeah, so just in terms of specific action items, too,\n",
            "[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  in terms of collecting that,\n",
            "[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  it sounds like we've got another set of bureaus,\n",
            "[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  and then we've got these.\n",
            "[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  Are you going to synthesize yours?\n",
            "[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  Well, I would say I can do is take what policy did\n",
            "[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  and then highlight the ones that were the crossover\n",
            "[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  and just add the few on here.\n",
            "[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  And that's what we'll do with PPO and systems\n",
            "[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  is I'll send that list and say,\n",

            "[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  and then what do you have like that,\n",
            "[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  and we'll continue to do that.\n",
            "[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  Would it be beneficial if I also provided a few examples\n",
            "[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  of the types of inquiries that come in from districts?\n",
            "[41:08.000 --> 41:11.000]  Yeah, I think that would be great for the team to look at.\n",

            "[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  That might actually, so they can look through the BPO mailbox.\n",
            "[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  That would be fine, too, if you're okay with that.\n",
            "[41:18.000 --> 41:22.000]  I've begun kind of making a table of the issues themselves,\n",

            "[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  Some are discussing policy and judgment\n",
            "[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  and legal and compliance.\n",
            "[41:32.000 --> 41:35.000]  Some are discussing decision and human procedure\n",
            "[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  as far as how to use the system or what to do, workflow,\n",
            "[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  and some are just describing the automated processes of the thing,\n",

            "[41:50.000 --> 41:55.000]  I think another thing on the chart is what impact does it have\n",

            "[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  improving either, which means funding in the end.\n",
            "[42:04.000 --> 42:08.000]  Collections, right, and customer service.\n",
            "[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  So performance and customer service,\n",
            "[42:10.000 --> 42:14.000]  because collections can fall within, obviously, performance.\n",
            "[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  Five key performance indicators.\n",
            "[42:18.000 --> 42:23.000]  Right, and which one does it impact principally each particular issue.\n",
            "[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  So it can sort of look at a table of these things.\n",

            "[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  and where there's some similarities in terms of categories.\n",
